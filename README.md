# Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks for the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification

### Abstract 
Hybrid quantum machine learning applications are developing rapidly, and while they still have not shown a practical advantage over classical machine learning applications, promising technologies have emerged in recent years. Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks, i.e., Quanvolutional Neural Networks, are remarkable technologies for image classification tasks, which step us closer to the goal of achieving the practical advantage of quantum computing. In this work, we implement Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks for the classification of pneumonia through chest x-ray images, as well as compare the model performance with different encoding strategies and a noise model. As a result of this work, we showed that the simulated noisy Quanvolutional Neural Networks with different encoding strategies outperformed classical CNNs.
